# CACTUS RUN PROJECT

###### This is my first game project. Made with lots of mistakes and continuous learning.

# About the game

###### Project: Is a copy-cat from Chrome T-Rex Run or Project Bolan - which itself is a reference to Marc Bolan, the late lead singer of 1970â€™s rock band T-Rex.

###### Ofcourse there's lots of improvement I could make and the code isn't the best thing in the world but at least is functional

## Gameplay
###### Just hit the Start Game button and the desert will move. Watch out for all those crazy Dino's T-Rexs trying to get you.

###### Run for the longest time you can to high score!

## How should you prepare to play

### Player

* Think like a Cactus
* Drink only some drops of water befor playing
